Today’s organisations operate within complex ecosystems, where digital technologies handle everything from production lines to security defences. While Industry 4.0 introduced automation and connectivity at unprecedented scale, its shortcomings underscore the need for more resilient, human-centred systems.

Metcalf (2024) argues that Industry 5.0 builds on these lessons by embedding human collaboration, sustainability and operational resilience into automated processes. In cybersecurity, for example, it means that AI-driven tools must work within experts, ensuring that critical updates and configuration changes undergo human review rather than blind deployment 

One specific incidents have underscored the societal scale of our dependency on these systems and their far-reaching consequences: 

On 19 July 2024, CrowdStrike released a routine content configuration update for its Windows sensor that inadvertently contained malformed data immediately crashing into “Blue Screens of Death” (CrowdStrike, 2024). Within hours, banks, hospitals and other crucial services found their systems unprotected. By 29 July 2024, most cases were back online, but the direct financial impact was huge and the customers’ confidence was deeply shaken.

This case reveals the over-dependency paradox: as systems become ever more interconnected, the fallout from a single component failure can cascade across digital and physical infrastructures. Industry 5.0 must therefore blend automation with active human oversight, chaos-engineering exercises and decentralised architectures so that neither a misconfigured update nor an unexplained blackout can incapacitate entire services (KPI, 2023).
